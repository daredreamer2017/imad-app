   Your Company achieved a turnover of Rs.43,337 crore during the
 Financial Year 2015-16, which is lower by 14% over previous year,
 mainly due to decrease in Net Sales Realisation of Saleable Steel of 5
 Integrated Steel Plants by about 20%. The prices of steel products kept
 falling throughout the year due to fall in Global Steel Prices leading
 to predatory imports from China, Japan, Korea, etc. However, there has
 been an increase in price realisation after imposition of Minimum
 Import Price(MIP) w.e.f. 5th February, 2016. The loss after tax of your
 Company for the Financial Year 2015-16 was Rs.4,137 crore compared to
 net profit after tax of Rs. 2,093 crore in the previous Financial Year.<br>
 <br>
 The performance of the Company during the year was adversely affected
 due to lower Net Sales Realisation, lower saleable steel production,
 adverse financial impact of on account of contribution to District
 Mineral Foundation and National Mineral Exploration Trust w.e.f. 12th
 January, 2015, higher usage of relatively expensive imported coal in
 the blend due to lower availability of indigenous coal, higher salaries
 & wages, higher repairs & maintenance expenditure, higher interest
 charges and reduction in interest earnings on term deposits, higher
 depreciation due to capitalisation of new facilities and
 non-availability of gain on sale of investment in Bokaro Jaypee Cement
 Limited considered in the previous financial year. However, the adverse
 factors have been partially offset by higher sales volume and lower
 imported & indigenous coal prices, reduction in coke rate, reduction in
 demurrage expenses, reduction in price of ferro alloys, etc.<br><br>
 
 SAIL continued its thrust on optimum utilisation of funds by better
 fund management. This included replacement of high cost short term
 loans with low cost debts, timely repayment of loans including
 interest, strategic parking of surplus funds with scheduled banks,
 advance actions for future fund raising, etc. to meet our growth
 objectives. Further, the Company hedged the foreign currency risk on
 Buyer''s Credit depending on market conditions. The Company had
 borrowings of Rs.33,217 crore as on 31st March 2016. The debt equity
 ratio of the Company increased to 0.85:1as on 31st March 2016 from
 0.69:1 as on 31st March 2015 due to increase in borrowings as well as
 reduction in net worth during the year. The net worth of Company
 declined from Rs.43,505 crore as on 31st March 2015 to Rs.39,281 crore
 as on 31st March 2016.
